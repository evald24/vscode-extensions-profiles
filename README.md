Lets you create profiles to include the selected extensions in the desired project.

Do you often have to work with different projects and different technologies?

Quickly and conveniently create profiles with the necessary extensions for working with various technologies.

## Further development

Explanation: 💡 - pending, ⚙️ ️- in progress, ❌ - cancelled, ✅ - done

In parentheses are those who proposed this idea:

- 💡 Apply a profile to a set of selected workspaces;
- ✅ Global profile ([drod3763](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-895592733), [jlongo](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-950224588));
- ✅ Import selected profiles;
- 💡 Multiple (combine) apply of profiles ([lakuapik](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-876195053));
- 💡 Recommendations for installing missing extensions;
- 💡 Convenient management of extensions for a separate project without linking to a profile or creating it;
- 💡 Create a profile from the current or selected project;
- ✅ Multiply delete profiles;
- 💡 UI to switch profiles, a dropdown box on the bottom status bar ([dnmalenke](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-1058163192)).
